# Fin Sim
### Purpose:
- The goal of this project is to make a simple tool that can project your investment value over a time period

### The Plan:
#### Phase 1
- Build a simple UI where data can be entered and then the output will be created with some simple numbers and a visual to show the trend over time
- Another tab will show how much a billionaires wealth grows
    - One part will show how fast it grows every second with a dynamic counter from the time you click on the tab
    - The other part will show a simple graph of the growth with some key metrics

#### Phase 2
- Build account creation and login functionality
- Create the ability to save different investment scenarios that can be called back up

#### Phase 3
- Build functionality to call an API like Yahoo Finance to do what-if investigations for what would have happened had you invested in a stock at a certain point in time
- Potential Bonus: Dynamically bring up interesting stock performances over different periods of time
